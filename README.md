**This is the first React App I attempted to publish!
I say attempted because I had quite a bit of trouble,
however I learned a lot in the process.**

## About this Site

This website took basically every major node on my CV
and presented them in order of what I thought to be
most to least important. I think that in some ways it
does reflect where I am now, but does not reflect where
I would like to be in the near future. On my newer site,
I've emphasized the tech skills I've learned primarily
over the past ~2.5 years. That's not to say that what I've
done outside of that is not deeply valuable to me and my
work, but I understand that it is not the first thing
most employers are looking for.

## What I Would Change

If I were to republish this site, I would probably start
by rendering all of the information at once - I don't
believe this site is big enough to warrant React Router.
I would also spend more time in Canva making the background 
such that it is good for desktop as well as mobile. Lastly,
if I were to stick to the original intention of the site - 
to showcase myself hollistically - I would make each section
more meaningful and would likely do away with the awkward
scrolling situation.
